# Release Notes - Version 1.1.0

## New Features

### List and Multi-List Picker Prompts
Select from predefined options instead of typing free-form text:

- **List picker**: Single selection dropdown
  ```
  {% Category:list:Work,Personal,Archive %}
  ```
- **Multi-list picker**: Multiple selection with checkmarks
  ```
  {% Tags:multilist:Important,Urgent,Review,Later %}
  ```

Features include:
- Auto-opens dropdown on focus
- Full keyboard navigation (arrows, Enter, Escape)
- Clear button to remove selection
- Multi-list shows "N items selected" count
- Selected values joined with comma-space for output

### Intelligent Bracket Auto-Closure
Smart auto-completion when typing prompt syntax:

- Auto-insert closing brackets for `{%`, `{%?`, `{{`, and `(`
- Auto-delete closing brackets when removing opening brackets
- Cursor positioned for easy `?` addition (optional prompts)
- Handles Obsidian's auto-close behavior to prevent duplicates
- Toggle on/off in settings (default: on)

### Live Format Preview in Settings
Settings autocomplete now matches the main editor experience:

- Live Moment.js format preview when typing inside `format(...)`
- Shows actual date/time output for format presets
- Cleaner single-pane rendering with inline details

## Date/Time Picker Improvements

### Enhanced Keyboard Navigation
Navigate the calendar entirely with the keyboard:

- **Arrow keys work immediately** when tabbing into a date field (no click required)
- **Edge-based navigation** creates a continuous calendar experience:
  - Left from Sunday → previous month (focus Saturday, same row)
  - Right from Saturday → next month (focus Sunday, same row)
  - Up from top row → previous year (focus bottom row, same column)
  - Down from bottom row → next year (focus top row, same column)
- **Alt+Arrow keys** jump months/years while keeping the same grid position
- **Shift+PageUp/PageDown** for year navigation
- Navigating over greyed-out days keeps the current view

### Slide Animations
Smooth visual transitions when navigating:

- Previous month: slides from left
- Next month: slides from right
- Previous year: slides from top
- Next year: slides from bottom
- Works with keyboard, header buttons, and swipe gestures

### Clear Buttons for Optional Fields
- Date, Time, and DateTime pickers now show a Clear button when the field is optional
- Easily reset fields without manually clearing

### TimePicker Improvements
- 12h/24h toggle now changes picker columns (2 vs 3 columns)
- Cleaner interface with redundant preview removed
- Configurable "Now" button visibility

### Better Focus Management
- CollapsiblePicker header is now the single tab stop
- Enter/Space toggles picker, Escape collapses, ArrowDown expands
- Fixed UX bug where picker closed immediately when clicking from another field
- Arrow keys no longer scroll the modal when focused on date picker
